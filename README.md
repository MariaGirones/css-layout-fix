I am a junior front-end developer focused on HTML and CSS, currently building real-world layout fixing projects to strengthen my skills in responsive design and UI structure.

This repository is part of my hands-on practice where I take a broken layout and progressively improve it by applying:

- Clean HTML semantics  
- CSS Grid and Flexbox  
- Spacing and visual hierarchy  
- Responsive design principles  
- UI polishing and interaction states  


I enjoy turning messy layouts into clean, functional, and visually pleasing interfaces.
